# Resume of Ashok Bommisetti

This is my resume (and CV) in LaTeX

This resume is based off a template I found, which was a modified template. I would add the history for the record in few days.

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux run
```bash
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``resumeName.pdf``

Ubuntu requirements:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra
```
